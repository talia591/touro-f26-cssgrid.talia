## **Code-Along Instructions**

### **What Is a Code-Along?**

A code-along is exactly what it sounds like: I write code, you write the same code. It's not a tutorial you watch — it's a session you participate in. Every line I type, you type. When I break something on purpose (or by accident), yours breaks too, and we fix it together.

**Why we do this:** The fastest way to learn to code is to actually write code. Not read about it, not watch a video — write it, break it, fix it. By the end of the session you'll have a working project that you built yourself, character by character.

### **Step-by-Step: Getting Set Up**


**1\. Click the green "Use this template" button**

This creates a brand new repository under your own GitHub account, pre-loaded with the starting files.

**2\. Name your repository**

Use this naming convention:

`touro-f26-codealong-01-lastname-firstname`

**3\. Click "Create repository from template"**

GitHub copies the files and takes you to your new repo page.

**4\. Click the green "Code" button → "Create Codespace"**

**5\. Wait about 5 minutes while it boots up**

This is normal. Codespaces is spinning up a virtual computer for you in the cloud, installing dependencies, and opening VS Code in your browser. Grab a sip of water while it loads.

## **GitHub Codespaces — A Brief Guide**

### **What Is It?**

Codespaces is a development environment that runs entirely in your browser. Instead of installing software on your own computer, you get a virtual computer in the cloud — pre-configured and ready to code — that you access through a web browser. Microsoft (which owns GitHub) hosts it.

### **What It Saves Us From**

Normally, getting a development environment set up requires installing and configuring a bunch of tools:

* A code editor (VS Code)  
* A terminal (command line)  
* Git (version control)  
* Node.js, Python, or whatever runtime the project needs  
* Extensions, themes, settings

Each one of these can break in unique ways depending on your operating system, your computer's permissions, or just bad luck. **Codespaces eliminates all of that.** You click one button and you're in a fully working environment. No "it works on my machine" problems.

### **How It Works (High Level)**

1. A project lives in a GitHub repository.  
2. You click the green **Code** button and select **Open with Codespaces**.  
3. GitHub spins up a lightweight virtual machine running Linux, installs the project's dependencies automatically, and opens a browser-based version of VS Code.  
4. You code, save, and commit just like you would on your local machine.  
5. When you're done, you stop the Codespace. Next time you come back, everything is exactly where you left it.

The environment is defined by a file called `devcontainer.json` (or `.devcontainer/`) in the repository. It's like a recipe that tells GitHub "this project needs X, Y, and Z."

### **The Catch: It's Slow to Start (And Why)**

A cold start takes **1–3 minutes**. Here's why:

* **A new virtual machine has to boot.** Codespaces isn't "running" until you open it. There's no always-on computer — one is created for you on demand. That means spinning up an OS from scratch.  
* **Your dependencies install.** If the project requires packages or libraries, Codespaces runs the install process when it starts. This is the same `npm install` or `pip install` you'd run locally — it just happens automatically.  
* **Extensions and settings sync.** VS Code loads your extensions, themes, and preferences from your GitHub account.

**Once it's running, it's fast.** The delay is only on the first launch of the day (or after you've manually stopped the Codespace). If you keep it open between sessions, there's no wait.

### **Tips**

* **Don't close your Codespace mid-session.** Just leave the tab open. If you close it, stop the Codespace from the GitHub dashboard so it doesn't eat into your monthly usage hours.  
* **Your work is saved automatically.** Even if the Codespace stops, the files are stored on GitHub. You won't lose anything.  
* **You get a fixed number of free hours per month** through the GitHub Student Developer Pack. A cold start uses some of those hours just booting up, so it's worth keeping one Codespace alive while you're actively working.  
* **If you need to work offline,** you can always install VS Code and Git locally instead but it does take some set up — Codespaces is a convenience, not a requirement.
